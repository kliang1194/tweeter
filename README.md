# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This app provides the user with the ability to post tweets to a Tweet feed. This app was built with Javascript, jQuery, AJAX on the front-end, and with Express and Node on the back-end. The contents of the app were built using HTML and CSS styling. 

## Core Features
- Start by writing a tweet in the tweet box and clicking on "Tweet". This will "Submit" the tweet to the back-end via AJAX.
- A successful POST request will then GET the tweet object back form the back-end and update the feed without having to refresh the page.
